# ZenFolio - your next js portfolio

this is a simple, clean, minimal, and fully functional portfolio website. this project is created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and for content management i've used [Hygraph CMS](https://hygraph.com).

By fully functional I've meant, that you can:

- customize almost everything
- manage your own blog
- showcase your projects & case studies
- create custom pages
- fully SEO optimized
